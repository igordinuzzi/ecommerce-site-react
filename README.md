![Cart Page](doc/features/06_02_cart.jpg)
The `Cart` component in this React application manages the checkout process for a shopping cart, including form validation and stepwise navigation. It uses `useState` for managing form data, errors, and the current step in the checkout process, and `useEffect` to calculate the total price based on cart items, taxes, and shipping costs. The component features:

Cart Item Listing: Dynamically lists items in the cart with prices.
Form Validation: Validates form fields with regular expressions and updates state based on user input.
Stepwise Navigation: Allows users to navigate through the checkout process in steps, with validation checks at each step.
Form Submission: Handles form submission with validation check, showing an alert if the form is not valid.
Visual Feedback: Uses FontAwesome icons to provide visual feedback on field validation.
Dynamic Form Rendering: Renders form fields based on the current step, including a custom component for payment options in the final step.

The component is styled with `Cart.css` and uses Bootstrap for layout and components like `Container`, `Form`, `Button`, `Alert`, and `ListGroup`. It also includes a `PaymentOptionsImages` component to display payment options during the final step of the checkout process.

```javascript
function Cart({ cartItems }) {
  const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState(1);
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
    name: '',
    lastname: ' ', // Initial value with a space
    address: '',
    homenumber: '',
    postcode: '',
    phone: '+31 ',
    email: '',
  });
  const [formErrors, setFormErrors] = useState({});
  const [totalPrice, setTotalPrice] = useState(0);


  useEffect(() => {
    const cartTotal = cartItems.reduce((total, item) => total + item.price, 0);
    const taxes = cartTotal * 0.21;
    const shipping = 23;
    setTotalPrice(cartTotal + taxes + shipping);
  }, [cartItems]);

  const renderCartItems = () => {
    return cartItems.map((item, index) => (
      <ListGroup.Item key={item.id || index}>
        <div className="cart-item">
          <div className="cart-item-name">{item.name}</div>
          <div className="cart-item-price">${item.price.toFixed(2)}</div>
        </div>
      </ListGroup.Item>
    ));
  };

  const handleChange = (e) => {
    const { name, value } = e.target;
    setFormData({ ...formData, [name]: value });
    validateField(name, value);
  };

  const validateField = (name, value) => {
    let isValid = true;
    switch (name) {
      case 'name':
        isValid = /^[a-zA-Z ]+$/.test(value);
        break;
      case 'address':
        isValid = /^[a-zA-Z ]+$/.test(value);
        break;
      case 'postcode':
        isValid = /^\d+$/.test(value);
        break;
      case 'phone':
        isValid = /^\+31 \d+$/.test(value);
        break;
      case 'lastname':
        isValid = /^[a-zA-Z ]+$/.test(value);
        break;
      case 'homenumber':
          isValid = /^\d+$/.test(value);
          break;
      case 'email':
      // Use a regular expression to validate the email format
      isValid = /^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4}$/.test(value);
      break;      
      default:
        isValid = value.trim() !== '';
    }
    setFormErrors({ ...formErrors, [name]: isValid });
  };

  const isFormValid = () => {
    return Object.values(formErrors).every((v) => v === true) && Object.keys(formErrors).length === Object.keys(formData).length;
  };

  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    // Use isFormValid here to ensure entire form is valid before submission
    if(isFormValid()) {
      // Implement submission logic here
      alert('Form submitted');
    } else {
      // Optionally handle the case where the form is somehow not valid at submission
      alert('Please ensure all form fields are correctly filled and valid.');
    }
  };
  
  const nextStep = () => {
    if (currentStep < 3) {
      setCurrentStep(currentStep + 1);
    }
  };

  const prevStep = () => {
    if (currentStep > 1) {
      setCurrentStep(currentStep - 1);
    }
  };

  const steps = [
    { title: 'Step 1', fields: ['name', 'lastname', 'address', 'homenumber', 'postcode'], contentType: 'formFields' },
    { title: 'Step 2', fields: ['phone', 'email'], contentType: 'formFields' },
    { title: 'Step 3', contentType: 'images' },
  ];
  
  const handleBlur = (fieldName) => {
    // Implement your field blur logic here
  };

  const isFieldTouched = (fieldName) => {
    // Implement your field touched logic here
    return true; // Placeholder, modify as needed
  };

  const isStepValid = () => {
    // Check if the current step has fields defined
    if (steps[currentStep - 1].fields) {
      const currentStepFields = steps[currentStep - 1].fields;
      const fieldsValid = currentStepFields.every((field) => formErrors[field] === true);
      const fieldsFilled = currentStepFields.every((field) => formData[field].trim() !== '');
      return fieldsValid && fieldsFilled;
    } else {
      // If no fields are defined for the step, consider the validation requirement met
      // You might want to adjust this logic based on your app's needs
      return true;
    }
  };
```

- ## Contact
![Contact Page](doc/features/07_contact.jpg)
The `Contact` component in this React application provides a user-friendly form for visitors to submit their contact information and messages. It utilizes `useState` to manage form data, sending status, and error messages. The form includes fields for the user's name, email, and a message, with basic validation to ensure no fields are left empty. Upon submission, it displays either a sending status or an error message based on input validation. The form is styled with a custom CSS file (`Contact.css`) and uses React Bootstrap components like `Container`, `Form`, `Button`, and `Alert` for layout and styling. The submission logic, intended for integration with Netlify's form handling, can be easily adapted for other backends or form processing solutions.

- ## Cookies
![Cookies Page](doc/features/08_cookies.jpg)
The `CookieConsent` component in this React application displays a modal window to inform users about the use of cookies on the website. It utilizes `useState` to control the visibility of the modal and `useEffect` to determine whether the user has previously given consent for cookies, leveraging `localStorage` to store this consent status. If the user has not given consent (`cookieConsent` not set to 'true' in `localStorage`), the modal is shown. The modal includes a message about cookie usage and an "I Agree" button. Clicking this button hides the modal and records the user's consent by setting `cookieConsent` to 'true' in `localStorage`. The component is styled with a custom CSS file (`CookieConsent.css`) and uses React Bootstrap components `Modal` and `Button` for the modal dialog and consent button, respectively.
```javascript
const CookieConsent = () => {
  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    const consentGiven = localStorage.getItem('cookieConsent');
    if (consentGiven !== 'true') {
      setShow(true);
    }
  }, []);

  const handleClose = () => {
    setShow(false);
    localStorage.setItem('cookieConsent', 'true');
  };
```

- ## FAQs
![Cookies Page](doc/features/09_faq.jpg)
The `FAQ` component provides an interactive Frequently Asked Questions section using React Bootstrap, featuring a dynamic list of questions and answers from an array (`faqData`). It includes a search function that filters FAQs based on user input, displayed in an accordion format for easy navigation. The component is responsive, ensuring compatibility across devices, and styled with a custom CSS file (`FAQ.css`). This setup enhances user experience by offering quick access to common queries and supporting efficient information retrieval within the application.
```javascript
function FAQ() {
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');

  const handleSearch = (e) => {
    setSearchTerm(e.target.value);
  };

  const filteredFaqs = faqData.filter(faq =>
    faq.question.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase())
  );
```

- ## Generic Banner
![Banner](doc/features/10_banner.jpg)
The `GenericBanner` component is a versatile and visually engaging part of a React application, designed to promote key actions or features within the site. It is structured using React Bootstrap components for a responsive layout and styled with a custom CSS file (`GenericBanner.css`). The component features two main sections within a fluid container for full-width display:

- **Left Banner**: This section encourages users to start selling their bikes by listing them on the platform. It includes compelling text ("Start Selling Your Bike Now"), a brief prompt ("Get ready to list your bike and find buyers!"), and a call-to-action button ("Get Started") that links to the `SellBikeForm` page using a `Link` component from `react-router-dom`. An image related to selling bikes enhances the visual appeal.

- **Right Banner**: Aimed at promoting the platform's mobile application, this section contains text inviting users to download the app for a better shopping experience, along with buttons linking to the Google Play Store and Apple App Store. These links are external and open in a new tab, ensuring the user's experience on the site is not interrupted. An app-related image complements the text.

Each section utilizes a `Row` and `Col` structure to ensure content is displayed optimally across different screen sizes. The use of external links for app downloads and internal routing for the platform's form page demonstrates a blend of navigation strategies to engage users effectively.

It's built using React and styled with a dedicated CSS file (`Hero.css`), incorporating React Bootstrap components for a responsive layout. The component features a two-column layout within a `Container`: 

- The left column (`Col`) contains the textual content, including a main title (`h1`) that introduces "Fietsen" as a destination for bike enthusiasts, and a subtitle (`h2`) that highlights the platform as a hub for buying, selling, and exploring bikes. A `Button` is included to engage users, encouraging them to start their cycling adventure by scrolling to the product list section of the site.
  
- The right column (`Col`) displays a promotional image, representing the theme of cycling adventure, making the Hero section visually appealing and balanced between text and imagery.

This setup ensures the Hero section effectively communicates the site's core message and entices users to engage further by exploring the products offered, serving as both an introduction and a call to action.

- ## Product Detail page

The `ProductDetail` component is designed to display detailed information about a specific product selected by the user. Built with React and styled with a custom CSS file (`ProductDetail.css`), it uses `useParams` from `react-router-dom` to retrieve the product's ID from the URL and finds the corresponding product from a predefined list (`products`).

Features of the component include:

Product Image and Information: Displays the product's image on the left half of the screen and detailed information such as the product name, description, seller, location, condition, and price on the right half.
Add to Cart Button: Includes a button that, when clicked, adds the product to the user's shopping cart through the `addToCart` function passed as a prop.
Social Share Icons: Offers social share buttons for Facebook and Twitter, allowing users to share the product with encoded URLs and text, enhancing the product's visibility and user engagement.

This component effectively combines product details, sharing capabilities, and user reviews, creating a comprehensive and engaging product page experience.

- ## Product list
![Products](doc/features/13_products.jpg)
The `ProductList` component is designed to dynamically display a catalog of products, particularly focusing on bikes with detailed attributes such as name, description, seller, location, condition, price, and an image. This React component is part of a larger application and offers several key functionalities:

Dynamic Product Loading: Initially, it shows a set number of products (16) and includes functionality to load more products or revert to the initial view. This is managed through state, using `useState` to track the number of visible products and functions to adjust this number.
Search Functionality: It integrates search functionality by filtering the displayed products based on a search term passed as a prop. This allows users to quickly find products that match their specific search criteria.
Responsive Layout: Utilizes Bootstrap's grid system to display products in a responsive layout, adjusting the number of columns based on the screen size (4 products per row on medium and larger screens).
Product Component: Each product is rendered using a `Product` child component, which likely abstracts the details of how a single product is displayed, including its image, description, and an "Add to Cart" action.
Interactivity: Includes buttons to "Load More" products or "Hide" them, enhancing user interaction by allowing users to control how many products they want to view at a time.

This component is styled with a dedicated CSS file (`Product.css`) and leverages React's component-based architecture to modularly display products, making it a versatile and user-friendly part of an e-commerce or marketplace platform.

- ## Product
![Product](doc/features/12_product.jpg)
The `Product` component displays information about a single product, intended for use within an e-commerce platform or product listing page. It utilizes React and FontAwesome icons to create a visually appealing presentation of each product's details. Key features of the component include:

Product Image: Displays the product's image, with the `src` path dynamically generated using the `product.image` property.
Product Details: Shows the product's name, description, seller, location, and condition, enhancing the listing with FontAwesome icons (`faUser`, `faMapMarkerAlt`, `faHeart`) to visually represent these details.
Price: Lists the product's price, formatted as a currency.
Add to Cart Button: Includes a button that, when clicked, triggers the `addToCart` function passed as a prop, allowing users to add the product to their shopping cart.
See More Link: Provides a `Link` to a detailed page for the product, using `react-router-dom` to enable SPA (Single Page Application) navigation without reloading the page. The URL is dynamically generated based on the `product.id`, facilitating access to more detailed information about the product.

This component is designed to be reusable, making it easy to list multiple products by mapping over an array of product objects and rendering a `Product` component for each one. It effectively encapsulates product information in a clear, concise format, encouraging user interaction through its "Add to Cart" and "See More" functionalities.

- ## Search
![Search](doc/features/14_search.jpg)
The `ProductSearch` component provides a user-friendly search interface, enabling users to filter through products based on their search terms. It employs React state management to handle the input value and dynamically update the search results through the `onSearch` callback function. Key features include:

Search Input: A text input field where users can type their search query, styled with CSS for visual appeal.
Dynamic Search: As the user types, the `onSearch` function is triggered, updating the search results in real-time based on the input value.
Clear Search: Includes a button with a FontAwesome `faTimes` icon to quickly clear the search field and reset the search results.
Search Icon: A magnifying glass icon (`faSearch`) visually indicates the search functionality.
Feedback on Results: Displays a message below the input field, indicating the number of products found based on the search term. This message dynamically adjusts to reflect singular or plural products based on the `productsCount`.

This component enhances user experience by allowing for easy navigation and filtering of products, making it an essential feature for e-commerce platforms or any application with a searchable product catalog.
```javascript
function ProductSearch({ onSearch, productsCount }) {
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');

  const handleSearchChange = (e) => {
    setSearchTerm(e.target.value);
    onSearch(e.target.value);
  };

  const handleClearSearch = () => {
    setSearchTerm('');
    onSearch('');
  };

```

- ## Sell bike form
![Sell](doc/features/15_search.jpg)
The `SellBikeForm` component is a multi-step form designed for users to list their bikes for sale. It's built with React and styled using React Bootstrap and FontAwesome icons for a visually appealing interface. Key features include:

State Management: Utilizes `useState` for tracking form data, validation errors, touched fields, progress through the form, and completion status.
Form Validation: Implements custom validation logic for each field, with specific rules for numeric, email, and text inputs, and displays error messages accordingly.
Multi-Step Navigation: Divides the form into distinct steps (Bike Details, Bike Description, Seller or User Info), allowing users to progress through the form or go back to previous steps. The current step is tracked with `useState`, and validation must pass before moving to the next step.
Progress Indicator: A `ProgressBar` component visually represents the user's progress through the form steps.
Conditional Rendering: Displays form fields based on the current step and shows a success message upon form completion. Error messages are shown if validation fails.
Form Submission: On submission, if all fields are valid, it simulates form submission and sets the form as completed, displaying a success alert.

Icons from FontAwesome are used to enhance the user interface, indicating the type of information required for each field. The form provides a user-friendly way to list bikes for sale, ensuring all necessary information is collected and validated.

## Existing Features and Features to Implement

**Existing features:**
Based on the described features, here is how you could describe the implementation of similar functionalities in a React context:

**React Implementation of Existing Features:**

1. **Navigation Burger Menu:**
   - Use React state to manage the visibility of the navigation menu. Upon clicking the burger icon, toggle the state to show or hide the menu.
   - Implement CSS transitions for smooth opening and closing animations.
   - Example: Use `useState` to manage a boolean state for the menu's visibility and a button to toggle this state. Apply conditional rendering or dynamic class names to show/hide the menu.

2. **Bouncing Calls to Action:**
   - Utilize CSS animations or a React animation library (e.g., `react-spring`) to create bouncing effects for call-to-action buttons.
   - Manage animation triggers using React state or CSS pseudo-classes (e.g., `:hover`).

3. **Dynamic Greeting Based on User's Timezone:**
   - Use JavaScript's `Date` object to determine the user's local time and set a greeting message accordingly.
   - Implement this logic within a React component, possibly using `useEffect` to set the greeting when the component mounts.

4. **Menu Tabs:**
   - Implement tabbed navigation using React state to manage the active tab.
   - Render different content based on the active tab state. This can be achieved with conditional rendering or a tab component library like `react-tabs`.

For each feature, React's declarative nature allows you to manage user interactions and UI updates in a more integrated way, reducing the need for direct DOM manipulations and simplifying state management compared to traditional JavaScript or jQuery implementations.

**Accessibility:**

[Wave Accessibility](https://wave.webaim.org/) tool was used throughout the development 
and for final testing of the deployed website to check for any aid accessibility testing.

Testing was focused to ensure the following criteria were met:

- All forms have associated labels or aria-labels so that this is read out on a screen reader to users who tab to form inputs
- Color contrasts meet a minimum ratio as specified in WCAG 2.1 Contrast Guidelines
- Heading levels are not missed or skipped to ensure the importance of content is relayed correctly to the end user
- All content is contained within landmarks to ensure ease of use for assistive technology, allowing the user to navigate by page regions
- All not textual content had alternative text or titles so descriptions were read out to screen readers
- HTML page lang attribute has been set
- Aria properties have been implemented correctly
- WCAG 2.1 Coding best practices being followed

Manual tests were also performed to ensure the website was as accessible as possible and an accessibility issue was identified.

I've discovered several errors on the webpage, specifically related to headers and the iframe. 
I fixed these issues to enhance accessibility and ensure that all users can easily navigate 
and interact with the content, promoting a more inclusive and user-friendly experience.
